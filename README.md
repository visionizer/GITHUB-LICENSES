# GITHUB-LICENSES
A collection of all github licenses.


## CAN I SUBMIT LICENSES?
Yes. As you may know, some repositories use their own licenses (e.g. Server Side License on MongoDB). Just create
a Pull Request where you add the LICENSE.LICENSENAME.md File and describe its pros and cons in the paragraph below.



## WHAT LICENSE SHOULD I CHOOSE?
If you want to use a website, we recommend [choosealicense](https://choosealicense.com/), but this website only offers all of the licenses available for github, here we hope to also show many custom licenses.
